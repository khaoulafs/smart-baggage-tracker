Build your portfolio project (Week 2)& Cleanup your Portfolio Project 
Project name: smart-baggage-tracker
who can detect the location of the bag (using GPS module)
Installation:using connection between GPS/GSM module and arduino 
The system is built using GSM/GPS module, which activates after the system finishes initializing; the GSM module sends a message to the end-user requesting whether to retrieve the luggage location. The GPS module retrieves the luggage location when the end-user sends the right command
 It then sends the information, which is the luggage location, to the Arduino Nano microcontroller for processing. After processing the information, the microcontroller sends the information to the GSM module, which receives it and sends it to the end-user via SMS (Short Message Service). 
The end-user can use the information displayed on the device, preferably a mobile phone, to find the location of the luggage on Google Maps

Usage: Detection of location of the bag using the IOT system
